# Quiz App using React

### 🏃 [Live Demo](https://amrl.github.io/quiz-react/)

## 🗼 Overview

A demo project made while learning React.

Idea and initial design based on [Scrimba: Learn React](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact/react-section-4-solo-project-co24f49bea8aace7c174082c8) and associated [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/E9S5iPcm10f0RIHK8mCqKL/Quizzical-App) file.

Quiz questions fetched from [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) API.

Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## 💡 Concepts

A few concepts learned and implemented in this project:
- Using React to create composable and reusable elements which can be dynamically rendered to a page
- Converting a basic design in Figma to a working application
- Using Hooks (useState, useEffect) to handle stateful logic within components
- Using PropTypes to ensure props passed between components remain the correct type
- Using React Router to route between pages according to links
- Implementing responsive design principles to adapt content style according to viewport dimensions
